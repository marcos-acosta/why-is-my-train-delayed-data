    "In this case, the issue at 23 St affects service on the `A`, but 23 St does not serve the `A` train! We can remedy this by looking at *lines* instead of individual stations. Our approach will be to group stations by line, and determine which services run on that line, as well as all the station names. Then, for a given station name and affected services, we match it to a line which includes that station name and contains that service. If this approach fails for whatever reason, we will pick a station at random whose name matches.\n",
    "\n",
    "One edge case arises in which a line contains a station which serves a route that does not run along the rest of the line. One example is BMT Broadway - Brighton, which includes West 8 St-NY Aquarium, which serves the `F`, despite the `F` not running along that line. This could cause issues because when searching for a train station called `\"23 St\"` that serves the `F`, the obvious choice would be the 23 St on the IND 6th Av - Culver, but the 23 St on BMT Broadway - Brighton would technically also be a candidate by our previous logic. We mitigate this issue by requiring that a service must be served by at least 3 stations on the line for it to \"count\".\n",
